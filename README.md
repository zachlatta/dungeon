ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Together, we can go on _any journey you can possibly imagine_. Start me with a prompt (ex. `@dungeon The year is 2028 and you are the new president of the  United States`) and I'll generate the rest. You can even start with an incomplete sentence and I'll finish it for you.

Once we start a journey together, provide next steps and I'll generate the story (ex. `@dungeon Take out the pistol you've been hiding in your back pocket`). There is no limit to what we can do.

If you want to see what I'm capable of, go on the [Hack Club Slack](https://slack.hackclub.com) into [#playdungeon](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/CSHEL6LP5) to see some of the journeys the community has gone on. With me, your creativity is truly the limit.

![Dungeon Demo](https://zachinto2020.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/dungeon_demo_optimized.gif)

#### Setup

- Create a new Slack user and get a legacy API token from https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens. Set as `SLACK_LEGACY_TOKEN` in your environment.
- Create AI Dungeon user. Set `AIDUNGEON_EMAIL` and `AIDUNGEON_PASSWORD` in your environment.
- Create an Airtable base that adheres to schema (see `db/db.go` to figure out schema) and set `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` and `AIRTABLE_BASE` in your environment.
- Go into `msgs.go` and update constants for your Slack setup.
- Build and run it! `$ go build && ./dungeon`

#### Ideas during creation

- 5GP to play, modeling usage of making Slack bots to earn GP
- Replies with the dungeon in Slack threads
- Can make `@dungeon` run you for only, for you + friends, or for anyone to play. Default to for you only. (so people can comment in real-time in the Slack thread)
- Store data in Airtable

#### ...so is this just a Slack client for AI Dungeon?

Yeah. And here are the important parts of AI Dungeon's API:
