# @dungeon bot

Slack bot to interface with AI Dungeon.

Setup:

- Create a new Slack user and get a legacy API token from https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens

Ideas:

- 5GP to play, modeling usage of making Slack bots to earn GP
- Replies with the dungeon in Slack threads
- Can make the dungeon run you for only, for you + friends, or for anyone to play. Default to for you only. (so people can comment in real-time in the Slack thread)
- Can play via DM (but perhaps make it more expensive to do so?)
- Store data in Airtable

Key flows:

- User mentions @dungeon asking for help
- User mentions @dungeon incorrectly

Other asides:

- @dungeon should invite @banker to the channel if it's not already in it

To-dos:

- [ ] Most basic flow working
